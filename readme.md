#IOT Fanspeed Controller (Raspberry Pi Project)

The home environment has seen a rapid introduction of network enableddigital technology. This technology offers new and exciting opportunities to
increase the connectivity of home appliances within the home for the purpose of home automation and remote controlling. Thus the already existing methods for
remote controlling of home appliances are Bluetooth, Zigbee, GSM based technology. But with the help of rapid expansion of the Internet, there is the
potential to control, network and automate the home appliance using it. As we know internet is being popular day by day. Its applications and internet based
devices growing and updating very fast. Internet may conquer the world under its hub in a very short span. So as we choose internet to control the home environment as it removes the connectivity barriers. It is achieved by interfacingthe internet with embedded systems. Here a Web based Home appliance control
system is implemented to show the remote controlling of home appliances over
the web. It can be organized intranet as well as internet based. Here we have
implemented an intranet based home appliance control through a web based
interface.
